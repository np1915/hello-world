# hello-world
I'm learning code--yeah!
I'm Michael. An old fart. Not too old to learn code I hope. Also hope to have the willingness and dertermination to give this a good go. So far, and I know I'm just starting, but I like this organization. I'm an organized person, so everything here makes good sense to me.
I'm slow, but this is still interesting.
